# 👩‍🔬 Hi, I am Carlotta, Molecular Mayhem & Code Chaos Wizard

Welcome to my GitHub lab bench, where pipettes meet pipelines, and bugs appear in both PCR and Python.

## 🧠 Who am I?
I’m Carlotta, a Molecular Biologist at the **German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)** currently finishing my **Master’s thesis**. My world lies at the crossroads of:
- 🧬 Wet-lab: from single-cell to FACs analysis.
- 💻 Bioinformatics experiments (some successful, others... instructive).

## 🧰 Tech I’m working with:
- **Languages**: R, Bash, Python (reluctantly), Markdown (obsessively).
- **Tools**: Seurat, CellRanger, DESeq2, Harmony, ggplot2, Scanpy, Scirpy, Micromamba (yes, really), and the occasional Jupyter notebook that won't die.
- **Environments**: HPC clusters, Conda envy, and just enough Docker to break things spectacularly.

## 🌱 Skills I'm growing
- 🔬 Data visualization that won't make reviewers cry
- 💥 Reproducibility 
- 🐛 Debugging code, pipelines, ...

## ☕ Fun facts
- I believe most bugs can be solved with coffee, cursing, or both.
- I once fixed a pipeline error by turning it off and on again. Scientific method? ✅
- My RStudio has more tabs than a bioRxiv preprint has authors.
